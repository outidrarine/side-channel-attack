# Side channel attack - Time attack

A build from scratch simulation for time attack on RSA altgorithm using python

# About :

>In computer security, a side-channel attack is any attack based on information gained from the implementation of a computer system, 
rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm itself (e.g. cryptanalysis and software bugs). Timing information, 
power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or even sound can provide an extra source of information, which can be exploited.

# Description : 

A simple simulation for a side channel attack, more precisely time attack on RSA algorithm, realised using python and by reading execution 
 time of some critical instructions on the **RDTSC - Read Time-Stamp Counter** register.

# Structure : 

This project contains : 
- A detailed [report](./Cryptographie_et_s√©curit__informatique_rapport_final.pdf) of studied topics to realise this simution of time attack
- The [simulation](./TimeAttack.py) of the Time attack using python and some assembley instructions
